# Static type checker for Python

### Speed
Pyright is a fast type checker meant for large Python source bases. It can run in a “watch” mode and performs fast incremental updates when files are modified.

### Configurability
Pyright supports [configuration files](/docs/configuration.md) that provide granular control over settings. Different “execution environments” can be associated with subdirectories within a source base. Each environment can specify different module search paths, python language versions, and platform targets.

### Type Checking Features
* [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) type hints including generics
* [PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) syntax for variable annotations
* [PEP 544](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0544/) structural subtyping
* [PEP 589](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0589/) typed dictionaries
* [PEP 591](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0591/) final qualifier
* [PEP 593](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593/) flexible variable annotations
* [PEP 604](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0604/) complementary syntax for unions
* [PEP 612](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0612/) parameter specification variables
* [PEP 613](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0613/) explicit type aliases
* Type inference for function return values, instance variables, class variables, and globals
* Type guards that understand conditional code flow constructs like if/else statements

### VS Code Integration
Pyright ships as both a command-line tool and a VS Code extension that provides many powerful features that help improve programming efficiency.

### VS Code Language Features
The VS Code extension supports many time-saving language features including:

* Intelligent type completion of keywords, symbols, and import names appears when editing
* Import statements are automatically inserted when necessary for type completions
* Signature completion tips help when filling in arguments for a call
* Hover over symbols to provide type information and doc strings
* Find Definitions to quickly go to the location of a symbol’s definition
* Find References to find all references to a symbol within a code base
* Rename Symbol to rename all references to a symbol within a code base
* Find Symbols within the current document or within the entire workspace
* View call hierarchy information — calls made within a function and places where a function is called
* Organize Imports command for automatically ordering imports according to PEP8 rules
* Type stub generation for third-party libraries

### Built-in Type Stubs
Pyright includes a recent copy of the stdlib type stubs from [Typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed). It can be configured to use another (perhaps more recent or modified) copy of the Typeshed type stubs. Of course, it also works with custom type stub files that are part of your project.

### Command-line Tool or Visual Studio Code Extension
Pyright includes both a [command-line tool](/docs/command-line.md) and an [extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-pyright.pyright) that implements the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/).

For rich Python editing and debugging capabilities with Visual Studio Code, be sure to also install the official [Microsoft Python extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=ms-python.python) as Pyright only provides syntax and type checking.


## Installation
### VS Code Extension
You can install the latest-published version of the Pyright VS Code extension directly from VS Code. Simply open the extensions panel and search for `pyright`.

### Vim
For vim/neovim users, you can install [coc-pyright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright), Pyright extension for coc.nvim.

### Command-line
The latest version of the command-line tool can be installed with npm, which is part of node. If you don't have a recent version of node on your system, install that first from [nodejs.org](nodejs.org). 

To install pyright globally:
`npm install -g pyright`

On MacOS or Linux, sudo is required to install globally:
`sudo npm install -g pyright`

Once installed, you can run the tool from the command line as follows:
`pyright <options>`

To update to the latest version:
`sudo npm update -g pyright`


## Using Pyright with VS Code Python Extension
Pyright provides some features that overlap with functionality provided by the standard VS Code Python extension: “hover”, type completion, definitions, references, rename symbols, etc. You may see duplicate results if Pyright is installed alongside the Python extension. You can disable the duplicate language service functionality in the Python extension by setting `python.languageServer` to `None`. If you want to disable language service features in Pyright, set `pyright.disableLanguageServices` to `true`.

## Limitations
Pyright provides support for Python 3.0 and newer. There is currently no plan to support older versions.

## FAQ
**Q:** What is the difference between pyright and the [Microsoft Python Visual Studio Code plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python)?

**A:** Pyright is focused on type checking. The Python VS Code plugin is Microsoft’s officially-supported extension for VS Code and provides a diverse array of features including debugging, test case management, linter plugins, and more. Pyright can be used alongside the Microsoft Python extension.

**Q:** What is the long-term plan for Pyright?

**A:** Pyright is a side project with no dedicated team. There is no guarantee of continued development on the project. If you find it useful, feel free to use it and contribute to the code base.

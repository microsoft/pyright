- [ ] should `src` be included in the path:

```
# definition  sam 87712958455b90fe8d0fb1a0fc110b41d6c3a361 `src.sam`/__init__:

vs

# definition  sam 87712958455b90fe8d0fb1a0fc110b41d6c3a361 sam/__init__:
```

It's weird that you'd get different symbols depending on where you index from.
ALSO: that can't be referenced externally RIP
